# Drum Machine

 ## [Codepen](https://codepen.io/lezojeda/pen/ZgoyNp)

Project for the FreeCodeCamp ["Build a Drum Machine"](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine/) challenge from the Front End Libraries section.
For this project I used only JavaScript (and HTML & CSS of course) and took the opportunity to practice and implement DOM manipulation learnt in [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info/document).
